# SQL for Data Science

## Overview 

As data collection has increased exponentially, so has the need for people skilled at using and interacting with data; to be able to think critically, and provide insights to make better decisions and optimize their businesses. This is a data scientist, “part mathematician, part computer scientist, and part trend spotter” (SAS Institute, Inc.). According to Glassdoor, being a data scientist is the best job in America; with a median base salary of $110,000 and thousands of job openings at a time. The skills necessary to be a good data scientist include being able to retrieve and work with data, and to do that you need to be well versed in SQL, the standard language for communicating with database systems.

This course is designed to give you a primer in the fundamentals of SQL and working with data so that you can begin analyzing it for data science purposes. You will begin to ask the right questions and come up with good answers to deliver valuable insights for your organization. This course starts with the basics and assumes you do not have any knowledge or skills in SQL. It will build on that foundation and gradually have you write both simple and complex queries to help you select data from tables.  You'll start to work with different types of data like strings and numbers and discuss methods to filter and pare down your results. 

You will create new tables and be able to move data into them. You will learn common operators and how to combine the data. You will use case statements and concepts like data governance and profiling. You will discuss topics on data, and practice using real-world programming assignments. You will interpret the structure, meaning, and relationships in source data and use SQL as a professional to shape your data for targeted analysis purposes. 

Although we do not have any specific prerequisites or software requirements to take this course, a simple text editor is recommended for the final project. So what are you waiting for? This is your first step in landing a job in the best occupation in the US and soon the world!

## Main Concepts by Week

### Week 1, Getting Started and Selecting & Retrieving Data with SQL

> In this module, you will be able to define SQL and discuss how SQL differs from other computer languages. You will be able to compare and contrast the roles of a database administrator and a data scientist, and explain the differences between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships with databases. You will be able to use the SELECT statement and talk about some basic syntax rules. You will be able to add comments in your code and synthesize its importance.

**Key Concepts**

- Distinguish between use of SQL for data science applications and SQL for more common data management operations.
- Use an Entity Relationship diagram, describing the data elements, their relationships, and inter-dependencies and determine if the existent data is sufficient to address a business question.
- Retrieve one or more columns of data from a table that relates to the research topic.
- Identify a subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and write a SQL query to limit to those results.
- Create an analysis environment and use INSERT to put data into a table.
- Add effective comments in your queries so that one, you can remember what you're doing, and two, so others can review your work.

### Week 2, Filtering, Sorting, and Calculating Data with SQL

> In this module, you will be able to use several more new clauses and operators including WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, OR, NOT, LIKE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY. You will be able to use the wildcard function to search for more specific or parts of records, including their advantages and disadvantages, and how best to use them. You will be able to discuss how to use basic math operators, as well as aggregate functions like AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and others to begin analyzing our data.

**Key Concepts**

- Compare analytics tool and CPU time performance between a filtered and unfiltered dataset.
- Given a dataset analysis requirement, use WHERE, IN, NOT, AND, and OR alone or in combination to filter the dataset.
- Determine whether or not to use wildcards in a data filter or search situation.
- Use wildcards to search or filter data based on requirements. Use regular expressions for text processing
- Use ORDER BY to sort data according to requirements for number of columns in the sort, sort direction, and sort position.
- Create common math operation calculated fields and aliases for calculated fields.
- Use AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM to profile data.
- Summarize data according to one or more criterion using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

### Week 3, Subqueries and Joins in SQL

> In this module, you will be able to discuss subqueries, including their advantages and disadvantages, and when to use them. You will be able to recall the concept of a key field and discuss how these help us link data together with JOINs. You will be able to identify and define several types of JOINs, including the Cartesian join, an inner join, left and right joins, full outer joins, and a self join. You will be able to use aliases and pre-qualifiers to make your SQL code cleaner and efficient.

**Key Concepts**

- Retrieve data from multiple tables using subqueries.
- Join tables using an Inner Join and table aliases.
- Filter a given data set using set theory by joining tables using Natural, Outer, and Self Joins.
- Assess the risk versus benefit of using a Cross Join or Cartesian Join on a set of data.
- Create an analysis table from multiple queries using the UNION operator.

### Week 4, Modifying and Analyzing Data with SQL

> In this module, you will be able to discuss how to modify strings by concatenating, trimming, changing the case, and using the substring function. You will be able to discuss the date and time strings specifically. You will be able to use case statements and finish this module by discussing data governance and profiling. You will also be able to apply fundamental principles when using SQL for data science. You'll be able to use tips and tricks to apply SQL in a data science context.

**Key Concepts**

- Manipulate strings, dates, and numeric data using functions to integrate data from different sources into fields with the correct format for analysis.
- Use Case / When statements to recode a set of data for grouping at a different level (e.g. cities to regions).
- Use Views to simplify SQL operations
- Identify organizational, governance, business, and data conditions that indicate use of a join to prepare data for analysis.
- Recite and implement the 3 rules for changing an analysis question into a sql statement
