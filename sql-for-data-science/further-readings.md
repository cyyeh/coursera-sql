##  SQL Overview

This module's primary focus was to introduce the world of SQL to you and to get you started with a few simple querying techniques. Attached to this posting, are a few good, quality overviews of SQL that go into a little bit more depth than what we can cover in our lecture videos. I encourage you to check out and review one or more of these resources.

## Data Modeling and ER Diagrams

We introduced ER diagrams and the concept of database modeling in this module. Naturally, these are deep topics and we barely scratched the surface in our lecture videos. I encourage you to review some of the resources below to learn more about these topics in more depth.
